I want to test large files sync. how can i get some large files? should i download some youtube files? is there any command tool for that? 

how about use SQlite3 in local folder for structurally showing some important activities? dont need to act like log, but critical checkpoints.

note we are using /home/celestial/dev/esdk-test/Edge-SDK/celestial_nasops/unified_config.json as the only source of configuration. don't repeatedly create other config files for similar matter.

 /home/celestial/.ssh/config for ssh connection to nas (host: nas-edge), as this is to ensure connection without password by using key pair.
